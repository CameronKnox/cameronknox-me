<p>At the moment, I&rsquo;m obviously building out this website—my personal website which is going to take some time. I want to get it looking acceptable.</p>
<h2 id="current-interests">Current Interests</h2>
<p>As for my current interests, <strong>AI</strong> is a big one. I&rsquo;m testing and using new models (Deepseek models at the time of writing this). Additionally, I&rsquo;ve been diving into <strong>3D printing</strong>. I recently got a Bambu Lab A1 with AMS, and I&rsquo;ve been printing a lot of cool things with it.</p>
