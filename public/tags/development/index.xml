      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve been tasked with building a new Learning Management System for my company. While we currently use Outsystems for deployment and development since we have another internal app running on it, I’ve found it frustrating to work with. Compilation is slow, the codebase is difficult to manage, and extending or customizing content is cumbersome.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So I decided to take a different approach for this project and build it with React.js and Vite. At first, I wasn’t confident I could deliver something the team would actually want. I struggled with imposter syndrome and genuinely thought I might fail.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
