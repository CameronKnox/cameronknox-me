## What I've Been Up To

This month I have been doing CSES challenges at [https://cses.fi/problemset/](https://cses.fi/problemset/). C++ is one of the languages that I have used in the past to build console applications but I am finding myself getting more interested in it again while doing these problems.

## Raspberry Pi Projects

Another thing that I also would like to start doing is using my **Raspberry Pi 4 Model B 2GB**. I bought it a while back and want to setup a server of some kind to either stream media or monitor my devices.
