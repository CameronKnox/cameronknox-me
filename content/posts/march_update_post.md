March has been an exciting month for diving deeper into programming and planning some hardware projects. Here's what I've been working on and what's coming next.

## Programming Challenges with CSES

I've been spending considerable time working through problems on the [CSES Problem Set](https://cses.fi/problemset/), and it's been incredibly rewarding. For those unfamiliar, CSES is a collection of competitive programming problems that really test your algorithmic thinking.

### Rediscovering C++

While I've used **C++** in the past for console applications, tackling these algorithmic challenges has rekindled my appreciation for the language. There's something satisfying about the performance and control that C++ offers when solving complex problems. The language forces you to think carefully about memory management and efficiencyâ€”skills that are invaluable in competitive programming.

### What I'm Learning

The CSES problems cover a wide range of topics:
- **Dynamic Programming** - Breaking down complex problems into simpler subproblems
- **Graph Algorithms** - Exploring connections and pathfinding
- **Data Structures** - Optimizing data access and manipulation
- **Mathematical Concepts** - Number theory and combinatorics

## Raspberry Pi Server Plans

I have a **Raspberry Pi 4 Model B (2GB)** that's been sitting idle for too long, and I'm finally ready to put it to good use. I'm considering several potential projects:

### Media Server
Setting up a **Plex** or **Jellyfin** server to stream my media collection throughout the house. The Pi 4 should have enough power to handle transcoding for a few devices simultaneously.

### Home Monitoring  
Creating a monitoring system to keep track of:
- Network device status
- Temperature and humidity sensors
- Home security camera feeds
- System performance metrics

### Development Server
Using it as a lightweight development environment for web projects and testing deployments before pushing to production.

## Next Steps

I'm planning to document whatever path I choose for the Raspberry Pi project. Whether it ends up being a media server, monitoring system, or something else entirely, I'll share the setup process, challenges, and solutions I discover along the way.

The combination of sharpening my programming skills with CSES and getting hands-on with hardware projects feels like the perfect balance of theoretical and practical learning.
