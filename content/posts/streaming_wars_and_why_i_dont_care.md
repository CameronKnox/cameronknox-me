# Why I Don't Stress About the Streaming Wars

Look, I get it. Everyone's got their own streaming setup. Some people are fine juggling Netflix ($7.99-$24.99/month), Disney+ Hulu ($13-$20/month), ESPN ($11.99-$29.99/month), Peacock ($10.99-$16.99/month), and whatever else comes out next week. Me? I'd rather not deal with any of that.

I spend $100 in Bitcoin on [TVPass](https://tvplans.org) and call it a day.

## Here's Why This Works for Me

The thing that sold me on TVPass is how stupidly simple it is. I'm not dealing with:
- Multiple logins across different apps
- Different billing dates I have to keep track of
- Content being split across five different services
- Apps that only work on certain devices

TVPass works on **all my devices**. Laptop, phone, Roku, iPad - doesn't matter. Same login, same content, everywhere.

And here's the kicker: I can stream on **4 devices at the same time**. So if I'm watching something in the living room, my partner's watching something in the bedroom, and we've got guests over who want to put something on in the guest room? No problem. No "too many devices" errors, no kicked-off sessions.

## The Bitcoin Part

Paying with Bitcoin is honestly just convenient for me. No credit card details to worry about, no chargebacks, no banks getting involved. Just send the payment and you're done. Plus, if you're already holding crypto, it's nice to actually use it for something practical instead of just watching numbers go up and down.

## What I Actually Get

For that $100, I get access to pretty much everything I'd want to watch anyway. All the major channels, sports, shows, movies - it's all there. No jumping between apps trying to remember which service has which show. No realizing halfway through a series that it moved to a different platform.

It just works. On any device. From any IP address. Four streams at once.

That's literally all I need.

## Why I Don't Care About the "Streaming Wars"

Companies can keep fragmenting their content and launching new services all they want. They can keep raising prices and bundling/unbundling things in different combinations. I'm completely out of that game.

I've got one service that does everything I need, I paid for it once with Bitcoin, and I don't have to think about it again until it's time to renew. No stress, no juggling, no nonsense.

That's worth way more to me than saving a few bucks by trying to optimize which services I subscribe to each month.
