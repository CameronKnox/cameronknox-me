# Why I Don’t Stress About the Streaming Wars

The major individual streaming services currently cost roughly: Netflix with ads at $7.99/month, Netflix ad‑free at $17.99/month, and Netflix Premium at $24.99/month. Disney+  Hulu together (ads tier) go for around $13/month, and their ad‑free duo is about $20/month. ESPN’s standalone streaming has two tiers: the Select plan at $11.99/month, and the Unlimited tier at $29.99/month. The bundle of Disney+ + Hulu + ESPN Unlimited (ads) runs about $19.99/month, and the same trio ad‑free (for the first 12 months) is $29.99/month, then increases. Peacock’s Premium ad‑supported is $10.99/month, and their Premium Plus no‑ads tier is $16.99/month. $100 Bitcoin for something like [TVPlans - TvPass](https://tvplans.org) just makes it way more appealing.

## Streaming Made Simpler

Instead of juggling half a dozen subscriptions, these platforms let you bundle access into one plan. The appeal is simple: **less headache, more convenience**. One login, multiple channels, one payment—no hidden fees, no bouncing between apps.

### Why Paying for Convenience Makes Sense

- **Saves money in the long run** – Duh.  
- **One-stop access** – No multiple passwords or apps to keep track of.  
- **Modern payments** – Some platforms let you pay with cryptocurrency, which is private, fast, and global-friendly.

### What It Feels Like

- Everything’s in one place, easy to browse  
- Works on smart TVs, streaming sticks, and mobile devices  
- Smooth streaming with minimal setup

## My Takeaways

- The streaming landscape is fragmented, which creates demand for simpler solutions.  
- Paying for convenience, privacy, and ease of use is worth it.  
- Technology is making it easier than ever to get multiple channels without jumping through hoops.

## Looking Ahead

Streaming options are only getting more complicated, but services that consolidate access and offer flexible payments (including crypto) will become more appealing. I’m looking forward to seeing:

- More bundled streaming plans  
- Payment options beyond credit cards  
- Cleaner, user-friendly interfaces for all platforms

For anyone who’s tired of managing multiple subscriptions, these consolidated solutions are a refreshing alternative. And honestly? Paying a bit more for simplicity and peace of mind is fine by me.
