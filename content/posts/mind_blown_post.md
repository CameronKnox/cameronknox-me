I’ve been tasked with building a new Learning Management System for my company. While we currently use Outsystems for deployment and development since we have another internal app running on it, I’ve found it frustrating to work with. Compilation is slow, the codebase is difficult to manage, and extending or customizing content is cumbersome.

So I decided to take a different approach for this project and build it with React.js and Vite. At first, I wasn’t confident I could deliver something the team would actually want. I struggled with imposter syndrome and genuinely thought I might fail.

That changed when I discovered Claude Code.

It completely transformed my development experience. Claude Code integrates seamlessly into my terminal and improved every part of my workflow. I’ve tried tools like Cursor and GitHub Copilot, but this is on another level. For just $20, I had a prototype deployed on Vercel in two weeks, which is an incredible value.

Yes, there are some limitations like message caps within a certain time period, but they haven’t been a major issue. I’m more excited than ever about the future of this project and can’t wait to demo what I’ve built.
