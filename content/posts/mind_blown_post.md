Recently, I was tasked with building a new **Learning Management System (LMS)** for my company, and the experience has completely changed my perspective on what's possible with modern development tools.

## The Challenge

Our company currently uses **OutSystems** for most of our applications since we already have another internal app running on that platform. While OutSystems has its place, I've found it increasingly frustrating to work with for this particular project:

- **Slow compilation times** that interrupt the development flow
- **Difficult codebase management** when trying to track changes
- **Limited customization options** for the specific features we needed
- **Cumbersome content extension** processes

## Taking a Different Path

Instead of forcing this project into the OutSystems mold, I decided to take a risk and build it with **React.js and Vite**. This wasn't an easy decision—I was stepping outside our established workflow and betting on technologies that weren't part of our standard stack.

### Fighting Imposter Syndrome

At first, I wasn't confident I could deliver something the team would actually want. The familiar voice of **imposter syndrome** kept whispering that I might fail, that I was in over my head, and that I should just stick with the established tools.

But sometimes taking risks is exactly what you need to grow.

## Enter Claude Code

Everything changed when I discovered **Claude Code**. This tool didn't just help me write code—it completely transformed my entire development experience.

### What Made the Difference

Unlike other AI coding assistants I've tried (including Cursor and GitHub Copilot), Claude Code integrates seamlessly into my terminal and enhances every aspect of my workflow:

- **Contextual understanding** of my entire project structure
- **Intelligent problem-solving** that goes beyond simple code completion
- **Real-time debugging assistance** when I hit roadblocks
- **Architecture guidance** for building scalable components

### Results That Speak for Themselves

For just **$20**, I managed to build and deploy a working prototype on **Vercel** in just **two weeks**. The value proposition is incredible when you consider what I accomplished in that timeframe.

## The Reality Check

I won't pretend it's perfect—there are **message caps** and some limitations within certain time periods. But honestly? These haven't been major roadblocks in my development process.

## Looking Forward

I'm more excited than ever about the future of this project. What started as a daunting challenge has become one of the most rewarding development experiences I've had. I can't wait to demo what I've built and show the team what's possible when you combine modern tools with the right mindset.

Sometimes the best way to overcome imposter syndrome isn't to ignore it—it's to build something that proves it wrong.
