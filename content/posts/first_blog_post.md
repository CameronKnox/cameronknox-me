Welcome to my personal website! This is my first blog entry, and I'm excited to share what I'm currently working on and what interests me.

This blog will be my space to document projects, share discoveries, and explore topics that fascinate me. I want to keep you updated on my journey through technology, creativity, and everything in between.

## Current Projects

Right now, my main focus is **building out this website**. While it may look simple now, I'm working hard to make it both functional and visually appealing. There's still plenty of work to do, but I'm enjoying the process of creating something from scratch.

## What Interests Me Right Now

### Artificial Intelligence
**AI** is absolutely captivating me at the moment. I'm constantly testing and experimenting with new modelsâ€”currently exploring the Deepseek models, which have shown some really impressive capabilities. The rapid pace of AI development keeps me coming back for more.

### 3D Printing  
I recently got my hands on a **Bambu Lab A1 with AMS**, and it's opened up a whole new world of possibilities. I've been printing all sorts of useful (and not so useful) things, learning about design, materials, and the incredible potential of additive manufacturing.

## Looking Ahead

I'm planning to document my experiments, share tutorials, and write about the cool things I discover along the way. Stay tuned for more posts about my tech adventures!
