This is going to be my first entry. This is my personal website, and while it's mainly just a blog, I'd like to use it to post most of the things I've been working on or plan to work on. I also want to share things that interest me at the time I'm writing. With that in mind, I thought I'd list some of the things I'm currently focused on.

## Current Projects

At the moment, I'm obviously building out this websiteâ€”my personal website which is going to take some time. I want to get it looking acceptable.

## Current Interests

As for my current interests, **AI** is a big one. I'm testing and using new models (Deepseek models at the time of writing this). Additionally, I've been diving into **3D printing**. I recently got a Bambu Lab A1 with AMS, and I've been printing a lot of cool things with it.
